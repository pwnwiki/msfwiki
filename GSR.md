| Metasploit: The Penetration Tester's Guide | by David Kennedy , Jim O'Gorman , Devon Kearns , Mati Aharoni.

| Packt Publishing Metasploit Books | by Several Authors. Packt Publishing has released several books on the frameworks all with less than stellar reviews. The best of them being "Metasploit Penetration Testing Cookbook, Second Edition" by Monika Agarwal and Abhinav Singh  | [Link](http://www.amazon.com/Metasploit-Penetration-Testing-Cookbook-Edition/dp/1782166785/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1401260292&sr=8-3&keywords=metasploit) |

| Metasploit Unleashed | MSU follows most of the same material in the above Metasploit book because some of the authors are the same. Metasploit Unleashed is maintained by Offensive Security and promoted by HDM and Rapid7. Sections contained are; Metasploit Fundamentals, Information Gathering, Vulnerability Scanning, Writing a Simple Fuzzer, Exploit Development,  Client Side Exploits, MSF Post Exploitation, Meterpreter Scripting, Maintaining Access, MSF Extended Usage, Beyond Metasploit. Although Offsec originally said they were going to do videos for the content at the low, low cost of a donation to Hackers for Charityâ€¦ people got busy. There exist several un-affiliated security folk in the video section who have followed the course syllabus and created video content. | [Link](http://www.offensive-security.com/metasploit-unleashed/Main_Page) |
